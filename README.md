# purr.io

### A hybrid-cloud data quality search engine for geoscientists and engineers.

#### Proprietary data stays on customer's LAN; business logic lives in the cloud.

Purr.io is a Supabase-backed, Vercel-hosted React app that acts as a "remote control" for a Windows Python client via websockets. It can identify projects and query asset data within geo-application databases on a customer's LAN in real-time.
